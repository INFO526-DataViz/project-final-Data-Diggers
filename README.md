# Visualising the Heavens

## An Interactive Spatio-Temporal Visualization of Meteorites Discoveries

This project was developed by Data Dynamos For INFO 526 - Data Analysis & Visualization at the University of Arizona, taught by Dr. Greg Chism. The team is comprised of the following team members.

Deema Albluwi (Computational Linguistics, PhD).

Rahul Bangad (Data Science, Masterâ€™s).

Swati Das (Data Science, Masterâ€™s).

Ansh Kumar Dev (Data Science, Masterâ€™s).

Shakir Ahmed (Data Science, Masterâ€™s)

## Data set:

The data is obtained from NASA. Data source: (https://data.nasa.gov/Space-Science/Meteorite-Landings/gh4g-9sfh/about_data)

## Shiny app hosting:

ðŸ”— The Shiny app is hosted on `shinyapp.io` website is present in this link: (https://rahulbangad.shinyapps.io/app1/))

## Repo Organization

-   `.github`: This directory contain files related to GitHub, such as workflows, issue templates, or other configurations.

-   `. _extra`: Contains code, notes and other files used during experimentation. Contents of this folder is not a part of the final output.

-   `_freeze`: The folder created to store files generated during project render.

-   `app1/`: This folder contains the Shiny app scripts used to generate the interactive shiny visual for the project outline.

    -   README.md describes the steps to run and generate the results using scripts


-   `data/`: This folder contains data files or datasets that are used in the project.

    -   README.md : A readme file that describes the datasets in more detail.
