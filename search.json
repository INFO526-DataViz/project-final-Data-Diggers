    "text": "Introduction\nIn the boundless expanse of the solar system, a hidden universe of rocky wanderers awaits for exploration. The secrets to solving the riddles surrounding the genesis and evolution of the solar system can be found within these space nomads, also known as asteroids, which are frequently written off as nothing more than stray pieces of a chaotic universe. In this project, we aim to create an interactive website to examine the asteroids impacts on Earth identified by Research centers.\nFor countless years, astrophysicists and enthusiasts have been enthralled with the fascinating universe of asteroids. These cosmic nomads captivate us with their enduring mystique; they are frequently perceived as leftovers of the birth of our solar system. This topic is brought to light by the enigmatic nature of asteroids and the mysteries they hold that have not yet been discovered. Motivated by the universe’s fascination and secrets, our research team discovered a shared passion for investigating the asteroid impact. It will provide a unique opportunity to look into the frequencies of these impacts and learn more about them."

    "section": "Data Utilization",
    "text": "Data Utilization\n\n1. Original data set:\nThe NASA data portal is the source of the asteroid data set for the project. The data set offers information about the asteroids, including their names, designation, discovery date, discovery location and the names of the individuals or institutions responsible for the discoveries. The data set retains its original presentation, without alterations to account for the loss of diacritical marks due to limitations in the ASCII character set. This version of data set includes 9999 entries and contains the information for all asteroids numbered as of 2nd February 1999 batch of Minor planet Circulars. These information were either supplied by the Minor Planet Center or taken from the Minor Planet Circular, which the organization distributed on behalf of Commission 20 of the International Astronomical Union.\nWe will be utilizing the following entries:\n• Catalog Number: The unique identifier for each asteroid, allowing us to track and reference them systematically.\n• Name: The official name of the asteroid, which can offer insights into cultural and historical contexts of the discovery.\n• Principal Provisional Designation: The initial temporary label given to the asteroid, crucial for cross-referencing with historical records and scientific literature.\n• Discovery Date: The date each asteroid was discovered, which will be used to create the temporal component of our visualizations.\n• Discovery Location: The geographic location where the asteroid was first observed, a key element in mapping the discoveries.\n• Discoverer(s) Name: Information about who discovered the asteroid, highlighting the human element in the field of astronomy.\nThe dataset’s ASCII character set limitation, which led to the loss of diacritical marks, will be addressed through a standardization process to ensure that names are searchable and display correctly. We will also be vigilant about the consistency in presenting names and locations, recognizing that some entries may include initials while others do not, and that the specificity of locations can vary.\n\n\n2. Backup Data set:\nWe are in the process of obtaining the above mentioned comprehensive data set from NASA. However, in case we are unsuccessful in doing so, we are going to use another data set from NASA for plotting of asteroid impact on Earth.\nLink: https://data.nasa.gov/Space-Science/Meteorite-Landings/gh4g-9sfh\n\n\nExtracting relevant information from dataset\n#Extracting relevant columns from data\n\nmeteorite &lt;- subset(meteorite, select = -c(nametype, fall))\n\ndiagnose(meteorite)\n\n\n# A tibble: 8 × 6\n  variables   types     missing_count missing_percent unique_count unique_rate\n  &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;chr&gt;             &lt;int&gt;           &lt;dbl&gt;        &lt;int&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 name        character             0           0            45716     1      \n2 id          numeric               0           0            45716     1      \n3 recclass    character             0           0              455     0.00995\n4 mass (g)    numeric             131           0.287        12577     0.275  \n5 year        numeric             291           0.637          266     0.00582\n6 reclat      numeric            7315          16.0          12739     0.279  \n7 reclong     numeric            7315          16.0          14641     0.320  \n8 GeoLocation character          7315          16.0          17101     0.374  \n\n\nFrom the above, we are going to use the name, id, mass to calculate the diameter of crater, year to create an interactive map visualization, geolocation to plot the location of the impact on a map plot.\nFrom the diagnosis, we can see that there are some missing values, but since our data set contains over 45,000 entries, it is negligible."

Timeline Visualization:\nAn interactive timeline will showcase the dates of asteroid discoveries. Users can slide through time to see the varying trends in asteroid impacts over the years.\n\n\n2. Map Integration:\nUtilizing the geo-location data, we will provide a map visualization where users can zoom in to the sites, providing a spatial context to the data.\n\n\n3. Asteroid Details:\nBy selecting individual asteroids, users will be able to view detailed information including the position, names, crater diameter and class of the asteroid.\n4. R Shiny application development:\nIntegrating and rendering of these asteroid impact for a more user friendly design and visualization. This will be useful for easy comprehension and accessibility to the general public.\n\n\n5. Educational Information:\nThe website will also include educational resources about asteroids, their significance in our solar system, and the history of asteroid discovery in Tucson."

    "section": "Implementation Plan",
    "text": "Implementation Plan\n\nOriginal Data set:\n\nTechnical Considerations:\nThe website will be developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The D3.js library will be instrumental for creating the data-driven visualizations. We will ensure the site is responsive and accessible across various devices and browsers. \n\n\nChallenges and Limitations\nA key challenge is the availability of the data set since it has been removed from NASA website. Also, the presentation of the inconsistencies in the data set, such as varying name presentations and location specifics will be challenging. We will need to decide whether to standardize these entries for consistency or to present them as they are, maintaining the data set’s authenticity. Finally, the limitation of data stopping at 1999 requires a clear communication to the users that more recent discoveries will not be included.\n\n\n\nBackup data set:\nWe want to visualize how the asteroid impact has changed over the years. To represent the available data best, we will be creating a geom map of the world that displays the impacts of various asteroids across the world. The comparison of the plot will be done through for each year from year 860 to year 2101 (in the future). We are planning to clean it further to only get certain parts that are required using dplyr. Additionally, data cleaning and preparation will be performed in order to account or omit the missing data.\n\nData load:\nThe shiny package enables the creation of interactive web applications, with leaflet being a powerful tool for handling spatial data visualizations. sf is used for working with spatial data objects, and shinythemes provides a range of Bootstrap themes for customization.\n\n\nCreating Shiny UI:\nWe wiill define the user interface (UI) of the Shiny app. In this step, we will choose a Bootstrap theme using shinythemes to enhance the overall visual appeal. We will add a title panel and navbar for easy navigation between different sections of your app. Inclusion of custom styling will be performed, such as changing the navbar color, can be achieved using additional HTML and CSS.\n\n\nCreating shiny app server:\nDevelop the server logic for your Shiny app. In this approach, we will use the leaflet package to create an interactive map displaying asteroid impact data. The renderleaflet function generates the leaflet map dynamically based on the input data. Additional server logic will be added to handle interactions and updates as users interact with the app.\n\n\nAdding branding and responsive design:\nEnhance the app’s aesthetics by incorporating branding elements. Adjust the navbar styling to ensure consistent color schemes and improve overall branding. Additionally, we will ensure that the app has a responsive design, making it accessible and visually appealing across various devices and screen sizes. This can be achieved through Bootstrap’s inherent responsiveness and further customizations.\n\n\nRunning Shiny app:\nSaving of shiny app code in a script file (e.g., “app.R”) and run it using the runApp(\"app.r\") command. This will launch a local web server and open the app in your default web browser."
