    "text": "Introduction\nIn the boundless expanse of the solar system, a hidden universe of rocky wanderers awaits for exploration. The secrets to solving the riddles surrounding the genesis and evolution of the solar system can be found within these space nomads, also known as asteroids, which are frequently written off as nothing more than stray pieces of a chaotic universe. In this project, we aim to create an interactive website to examine the asteroids impacts on Earth identified by Research centers.\nFor countless years, astrophysicists and enthusiasts have been enthralled with the fascinating universe of asteroids. These cosmic nomads captivate us with their enduring mystique; they are frequently perceived as leftovers of the birth of our solar system. This topic is brought to light by the enigmatic nature of asteroids and the mysteries they hold that have not yet been discovered. Motivated by the universe’s fascination and secrets, our research team discovered a shared passion for investigating the asteroid impact. It will provide a unique opportunity to look into the frequencies of these impacts and learn more about them."

    "section": "Data Utilization",
    "text": "Data Utilization\nThe NASA data portal is the source of the asteroid data set for the project. The data set offers information about the asteroids, including their names, designation, discovery date, discovery location and the names of the individuals or institutions responsible for the discoveries. The data set retains its original presentation, without alterations to account for the loss of diacritical marks due to limitations in the ASCII character set. This version of data set includes 9999 entries and contains the information for all asteroids numbered as of 2nd February 1999 batch of Minor planet Circulars. These information were either supplied by the Minor Planet Center or taken from the Minor Planet Circular, which the organization distributed on behalf of Commission 20 of the International Astronomical Union.\nData Link: https://sbn.psi.edu/pds/resource/discover.html\nWe will be utilizing the following entries:\n• Catalog Number: The unique identifier for each asteroid, allowing us to track and reference them systematically.\n• Name: The official name of the asteroid, which can offer insights into cultural and historical contexts of the discovery.\n• Principal Provisional Designation: The initial temporary label given to the asteroid, crucial for cross-referencing with historical records and scientific literature.\n• Discovery Date: The date each asteroid was discovered, which will be used to create the temporal component of our visualizations.\n• Discovery Location: The geographic location where the asteroid was first observed, a key element in mapping the discoveries.\n• Discoverer(s) Name: Information about who discovered the asteroid, highlighting the human element in the field of astronomy.\nThe dataset’s ASCII character set limitation, which led to the loss of diacritical marks, will be addressed through a standardization process to ensure that names are searchable and display correctly. We will also be vigilant about the consistency in presenting names and locations, recognizing that some entries may include initials while others do not, and that the specificity of locations can vary."

Timeline Visualization:\nAn interactive timeline will showcase the dates of asteroid discoveries. Users can slide through time to see the asteroid path.\n\n\n2. Geo spatial integration:\nUtilizing the details from the dataset, we will plot the asteroid path and show the progression of the asteroid along with the speed of the asteroid.\n\n\n3. Asteroid Details:\nBy selecting individual asteroids, users will be able to view detailed information including the position, names, class of the asteroid and discoverer names as well as the data of discovery.\n\n\n4. Educational Information:\nThe website will also include educational resources about asteroids, their significance in our solar system, and the history of asteroid discovery in Tucson."

The D3.js library will be instrumental for creating the data-driven visualizations. We will ensure the site is responsive and accessible across various devices and browsers. \n\n\nChallenges and Limitations\nThe presentation of the inconsistencies in the data set, such as varying name presentations and location specifics will be challenging. We will need to decide whether to standardize these entries for consistency or to present them as they are, maintaining the data set’s authenticity. Finally, the limitation of data stopping at 1999 requires a clear communication to the users that more recent discoveries will not be included.\n\n\nSteps to attack the project:\n1. Project Setup: Create a new project directory and set up HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files (index.html, style.css, script.js).\n2. Include D3.js and HTML structure: Download and include HTML style to be rendered as a GitHub page.\n3. JavaScript (D3.js) Implementation:\na) Use D3.js to create a data-driven visualization of the asteroid path.\nb) Include asteroid path data.\nc) Use D3.js functions to bind data, create SVG elements, and update the visualization.\n4. Responsive Design: Ensure that the visualization adapts to different screen sizes and utilize D3.js and CSS media queries for responsiveness.\n5. Testing: Test the visualization on various devices and browsers to ensure compatibility.\n6. Documentation: Provide clear documentation for the code and data sources used.\n7. Deployment: Deploy the project as a GitHub page.\n8. Presentation: Create a presentation for final project."
