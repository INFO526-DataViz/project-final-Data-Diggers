## Introduction: {.smaller}

-   Meteorites are like celestial time capsules, encapsulate the enigmatic history of our solar system.
-   Our initiative introduces an interactive platform sourced from NASA's Meteorite Landings, aiming to unveil the enthralling saga of these cosmic wonders.

## Goal and problem statement: {.smaller}

-   Our Shiny app features three key visualizations---world map, density map, and bubble map---showcasing meteorite landings across regions, offering insights into their distribution, density, and mass significance.

-   The question we will be answering is- "What are the noticeable trends in meteor impact on Earth?"

## Execution of plan: {.smaller}

-   Plotting of individual impact of meteor with various parameters like- mass and year.

-   Integration into an R Shiny application.

-   Revision and building on responsiveness of plot.

## Data Overview: {.smaller}

-   Data source: NASA's Meteorite Landings dataset.
-   Data Scope : Name, Recclass, Mass (g), Fall, Year

```{r slide4, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Data Read"

meteorite = read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/INFO526-DataViz/project-final-Data-Dynamos/main/data/Meteorite_Landings.csv")

diagnose(meteorite)
```

## Data pre-processing: {.smaller}

For our pre-processing, we have done the following:

-   Dropped all the missing values to a get a new row value of 37,417.

-   Filtered for mass greater than 1, as there were lot of values close to 0.

-   Renamed and cleaned names of columns.

# Plots

## Point plot: {.smaller}

1). Which continents appear to have the highest density of meteorite impacts based on the data visualized in the provided plot?

![](images/point.JPG)

## Point plots: {.smaler}

-   High Impact Density: Europe and North America show a high density of meteorite impacts.

-   Moderate Impact Density: Parts of Asia and Africa display a moderate concentration of impacts.

-   Lower Impact Density: South America and Australia have fewer impacts compared to Europe and North America.

-   Minimal Impact Reporting: Antarctica has the least number of recorded impacts, potentially due to underreporting.

## Density plot: {.smaller}

2). What does the thermal map suggest about the geographical distribution of meteorite impacts across the world?

![](images/density.JPG)

## Density plot: {.smaller}

-   Concentrated Zones: The map highlights areas with a significant concentration of meteorite impacts through thermal rings.

-   Major Impact Regions: Regions with the densest meteorite activity include parts of North America, Europe, and Asia.

-   Secondary Impact Zones: Lesser concentrations are visible in South America, Africa, and Australia. Oceans and Antarctica: The map shows minimal impact activity in the oceans and Antarctica. Data

-   Interpretation: The thermal rings suggest areas where meteorites are most commonly found or reported. Reporting Bias: The concentration of impacts may be influenced by the ease of meteorite discovery and reporting mechanisms in different regions.

## Bubble plot: {.smaller}

3). How does the mass of meteorites vary across different regions of the world?

![](images/bubble.JPG)

## Bubble plot: {.smaller}

-   Variation in Mass: The map shows a variation in meteorite mass with some regions exhibiting larger meteorites than others.

-   Larger Meteorites: Regions with notably larger meteorites, as indicated by bigger bubbles, include parts of North America, Europe, and Asia. Smaller Meteorites:

-   Smaller meteorites, represented by smaller bubbles, are widely scattered across all continents.

-   Mass Concentration: There is a concentration of larger meteorite masses in the northern hemisphere.

-   Oceanic Impacts: Fewer large meteorites are noted in the oceans, likely due to the difficulty in discovering them.

## Designing the Shiny App: {.smaller}

User Interactivity Features:

1.  Temporal Analysis

2.  Spatial Distribution

3.  Size and Classification Analysis

## R Shiny application: {.smaller}

## Impact and Applications: {.smaller}

-   This visualization serves as an engaging educational tool, aiding astronomy enthusiasts, students, and researchers in understanding meteorite impacts' global distribution, sizes, and densities.
-   Researchers can leverage this visualization to conduct in-depth studies on meteorite falls over time, identifying trends, hotspots, and variations in impact frequencies across different periods and regions.

## Future Enhancements: {.smaller}

-   Introducing a feature that allows users to access in-depth meteorite details simply by hovering over impact sites on the map.

-   This enhancement will provide immediate access to essential specifics such as meteorite names, formation years, and other crucial attributes, facilitating deeper insights into each meteorite.

## Challenges: {.smaller}

-   Data Limitations: Addressing the challenge of underrepresented areas due to lack of reporting or discovery, especially in remote regions.

-   Technological Barriers: Overcoming technical limitations in handling and processing large datasets with high accuracy.

-   Public Engagement: Ensuring the Shiny app remains user-friendly and engaging for a diverse audience, encouraging public interaction and education.

## Conclusion and Q&A. {.smaller}

-   Global Distribution: The data and visualizations reveal a global distribution of meteorite impacts, with varying densities and masses.

-   Density Concentration: Impact density is higher in populated regions, suggesting better reporting or more extensive discoveries due to human activity.

-   Mass Observations: Larger meteorite masses are found sporadically, with notable occurrences in the Northern Hemisphere, particularly North America, Europe, and Asia. Visualization Effectiveness:

    The Shiny app effectively visualizes complex data, allowing for interactive exploration of meteorite impacts by year and mass.
