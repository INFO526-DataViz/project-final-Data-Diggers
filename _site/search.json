    "text": "Introduction\nIn the boundless expanse of the solar system, a hidden universe of rocky wanderers awaits for exploration. The secrets to solving the riddles surrounding the genesis and evolution of the solar system can be found within these space nomads, also known as meteorites, which are frequently written off as nothing more than stray pieces of a chaotic universe. In this project, we aim to create an interactive website to examine the meteorites impacts on Earth identified by Research centers.\nFor countless years, astrophysicists and enthusiasts have been enthralled with the fascinating universe of meteorites. These cosmic nomads captivate us with their enduring mystique; they are frequently perceived as leftovers of the birth of our solar system. This topic is brought to light by the enigmatic nature of meteorites and the mysteries they hold that have not yet been discovered. Motivated by the universe’s fascination and secrets, our research team discovered a shared passion for investigating the meteorites impact. It will provide a unique opportunity to look into the frequencies of these impacts and learn more about them."

The D3.js library will be instrumental for creating the data-driven visualizations. We will ensure the site is responsive and accessible across various devices and browsers. \n\n\nChallenges and Limitations\nA key challenge is the availability of the dataset since it has been removed from Nasa's website. Also, the presentation of the inconsistencies in the dataset, such as varying name presentations and location specifics will be challenging. We will need to decide whether to standardize these entries for consistency or to present them as they are, maintaining the dataset’s authenticity. Finally, the limitation of data stopping at 1999 requires a clear communication to the users that more recent discoveries will not be included.\n\n\nConclusion\nThis interactive website will not only fulfill the requirements for our final project but also serve as a bridge between historical astronomical data and modern-day data visualization techniques. It will contribute to the greater public understanding of Tucson’s role in asteroid discovery and the importance of data visualization in narrating the story of our skies."

    "text": "Plan of attack:\nWe want to visualize how the meteorite impact has changed over the years. To represent the available data best, we will be creating a geom map of the world that displays the impacts of various meteorite across the world. The comparison of the plot will be done through for each year from year 860 to year 2101 (in the future). We are planning to clean it further to only get certain parts that are required using `dplyr`. Additionally, data cleaning and preparation will be performed in order to account or omit the missing data.\n1. Data Load: The shiny package enables the creation of interactive web applications, with leaflet being a powerful tool for handling spatial data visualizations. sf is used for working with spatial data objects, and shinythemes provides a range of Bootstrap themes for customization.\n2. Creating Shiny UI: We will define the user interface (UI) of the Shiny app. In this step, we will choose a Bootstrap theme using shinythemes to enhance the overall visual appeal. We will add a title panel and navbar for easy navigation between different sections of your app. Inclusion of custom styling will be performed, such as changing the navbar color, can be achieved using additional HTML and CSS.\n3. Create Shiny app server: Develop the server logic for your Shiny app. In this approach, we will use the leaflet package to create an interactive map displaying asteroid impact data. The renderleaflet function generates the leaflet map dynamically based on the input data. Additional server logic will be added to handle interactions and updates as users interact with the app.\n4. Adding branding and responsive design: Enhance the app’s aesthetics by incorporating branding elements. Adjust the navbar styling to ensure consistent color schemes and improve overall branding. Additionally, we will ensure that the app has a responsive design, making it accessible and visually appealing across various devices and screen sizes. This can be achieved through Bootstrap’s inherent responsiveness and further customizations.\n5. Running Shiny app: Saving of shiny app code in a script file (e.g., “app.R”) and run it using the runApp(\"app.r\") command. This will launch a local web server and open the app in your default web browser."

    "section": "Approach",
    "text": "Approach\nIn our Shiny app, we’ve integrated three primary visualizations: a world map, a density map, and a bubble map, each depicting the meteorite landings across various regions over time. These visual representations offer distinct insights into the geographical distribution, concentration density, and mass significance of meteorite impacts. We initiated data exploration to extract relevant information and identify interesting details. The overall plan involves initially preparing and processing the data, followed by creating comprehensive visualizations. These visualizations are then seamlessly integrated into the Shiny app, providing an interactive user experience.\nIn our approach for preparing and processing the data, we first ensured the necessary libraries were loaded using the pacman package in R. After importing the data, we began the pre-processing phase. This involved renaming certain columns and eliminating irrelevant columns like ‘nametype’ and fall. Furthermore, we introduced a new column, decade, to categorize meteorite landings based on their respective years. This meticulous process aimed to refine the dataset, setting the groundwork for subsequent analysis and visualization steps.\nThe sf package is employed to showcase the locations of meteorite landings on a global map. It begins by tabulating meteorites on an annual basis. Subsequently, the ne_countries() function from the rnaturalearth package is employed to construct a world map, specifying the desired scale normal and return class. The geom_sf() function is then applied to layer this map, visually depicting meteorite impacts with longitude and latitude coordinates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubsequently, we created a thermal density map illustrating the concentration of meteorite impacts across various geographical locations. Using the ne_countries() function from the rnaturalearth package, we generated a world map with a medium scale and specified return class. These maps were then overlaid with density contours formed by the geom_density_2d() function, visually depicting the meteorite impact density based on longitude and latitude coordinates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, we have constructed a bubble map showcasing meteorite mass distribution across various geographic locations. It integrates a world map as the base layer using geom_sf(), and then plots meteorite landings as individual points. Each point’s size represents the meteorite’s mass, creating a bubble map effect to visualize mass distribution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n######HEAT MAP######\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_sf(data = world, fill = \"lightgrey\") +\n  geom_bin2d(data = meteorite, aes(x = reclong, y = reclat, fill = ..count..), bins = 100) +\n  scale_fill_viridis_c() +\n  labs(title = \"Heatmap of Meteorite Impacts\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n######HEXBIN PLOT#####\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(hexbin)\n\nhex_meteorite &lt;- hexbin(meteorite$reclong, meteorite$reclat, xbins = 30)\n\n# Get hexagon data\nhex_df &lt;- data.frame(\n  x = hex_meteorite@xcm,\n  y = hex_meteorite@ycm,\n  count = hex_meteorite@count\n)\n\n# Create a world map\nworld &lt;- map_data(\"world\")\n\n# Plot hexbin map with ggplot2\nggplot() +\n  geom_polygon(data = world, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group), fill = \"lightgrey\") +\n  geom_hex(data = hex_df, aes(x = x, y = y, fill = count), stat = \"identity\") +\n  scale_fill_viridis_c() +  # You can choose any color scale you prefer\n  geom_point(data = meteorite, aes(x = reclong, y = reclat), color = \"red\", size = 2, alpha = 0.5) +\n  labs(title = \"Hexbin Map of Meteorite Impacts\") +\n  coord_fixed()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, the Shiny app integrates user interaction with visual representations to enable a comprehensive exploration of meteorite impacts over different periods and mass ranges. It includes diverse visualizations like World Maps, Density Maps, and Bubble Maps, displaying the geographical spread, size, and density of meteorite impacts. Users have the option to choose specific criteria like year ranges and meteorite mass through sliders.

It facilitates a comprehensive understanding of the distribution, density, and diverse sizes of these celestial remnants. By providing adjustable parameters and varied visualizations, users can dynamically tailor their explorations. The interactive sliders allow for the specific selection of years or meteorite mass ranges, offering a refined focus for analysis.\nThrough its visual representations, the app unfolds an array of maps: the World Map, a canvas revealing the precise locations of meteorite landings globally; Density maps, outlining concentration patterns across regions with distinct contour insights; and Bubble maps, where bubble sizes correspond to meteorite masses, offering a visual spectrum for understanding the range of meteorite sizes. These maps serve distinct analytical purposes, enabling users to delve deeper into the fascinating realm of meteorite impacts and uncover nuanced patterns and trends present in these cosmic phenomena."
